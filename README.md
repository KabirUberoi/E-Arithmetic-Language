# E++: Arithmetic Expression Evaluating Language

E++ is a custom arithmetic expression evaluating language developed in C++. The primary objective of E++ is to handle and perform calculations on integers and rational numbers of arbitrary size with high precision. The project features custom data types and robust parsing and evaluation mechanisms to manage complex arithmetic expressions efficiently.
